            <p>Around the turn of the century, I read about the Hiddink device on the keelynet mailing list. I was interesting in it because 
                "a Vandegraaff can only deliver a very small amount of power continously. It is not accumulative. The capacitor/ sphere gets 
                charged up in about 1 second, and releases that energy in less than one millisecond."

            <p>aether22 was in contact with Hiddink and made some interesting posts:</p>
            <aside>
                <p>After talking to Joseph (phone and email), I don't think there is anything hidden.
    
                    You simply need the tube to be plain glass without any UV reducing coating, and possibly a fast extinguishing plasma (fluorescent stay active a while possible killing the effect) argon or neon should both do.  (I think glass does interfere with UV though so maybe UV tubes use quartz? I am unsure, plastic may work but don't expect a long life from it)
                    
                    He suggested tiny NE-2 bulbs could be used, his only objection to Xenons was that they are too expensive. (again though he objects to coating, if it is because the UV must escape (UV and IR are meant to be related to the aether with some pretty wild claims) then glass IIRC won't work as it blocks UV so it may really be a good idea to use UV fluorescent tubes with possibly a custom gas filling as they musty be quartz?)
                    
                    Edwin used air and I am pretty sure Paul Bauman did too, of course you may need higher voltages applied across the tube in that case (Not high voltages charging the cap though!) but fancy gas isn't required.
                    
                    A TC or flyback may be suited to providing the HV to make the air into a plasma.

            <p>Hiddink mentions a Hurwich who came by and stole his work. It seems to be the same person in this article.</p>
